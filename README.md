Arduino-Filter-Wheel- Xagyl-compatible-ASCOM-and-INDI-
A motorised filter wheel control SW. The wheel is motorised with a 28BYJ-48 stepper with control provided by an Arduino Nano. The firmware is compatible with Xagyl Indi and ASCOM drivers.

Originally forked from https://github.com/Blueshawk/Rayz-indi-wheel 

Further optimized the code for more precision and reliability and made it compatible with different hall sensor type which requires resetting on each trigger.
Added PlatformIO support.
